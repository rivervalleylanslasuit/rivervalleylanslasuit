LendingPoint specifically caters to borrowers who are considered “near-prime.” The lender leverages technology that looks beyond credit scores to evaluate personal loan applicants and tailor the most ideal loan solutions.

Loan amounts range from $2,000 to $36,500, and there are no prepayment penalties if you choose to repay your debt sooner. Depending on where you live, you may incur an origination fee of up to 8 percent.
